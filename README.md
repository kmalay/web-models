# Web Models UI
### web-models

A user interface that allows users to select from a wide array of functional models.  Once a model is chosen, it's associated input parameters are conditionally displayed.

You can then supply custom values and execute the model.  It uses normal form controls for user input and a web map to allow users to draw geometry to add to their query.


### TODO:
* Update markup to include one common set of form controls shared by the six models
* Add logic to conditionally display drawing buttons
* Add global variable to capture type of geometry
